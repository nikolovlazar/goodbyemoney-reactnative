# Goodbye Money ðŸ‘‹

Goodbye Money is an Expense Tracking app built as part of my [live stream series](https://nikolovlazar.com/twitch) that cover building the app in 4 different frameworks:

1. [SwiftUI](https://github.com/nikolovlazar/goodbyemoney-ios)
2. [Flutter](https://github.com/nikolovlazar/goodbyemoney-flutter)
3. [React Native](https://github.com/nikolovlazar/goodbyemoney-reactnative) (this repo)
4. MAUI

This repo contains the React Native code.
